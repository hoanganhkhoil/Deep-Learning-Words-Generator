# Deep-Learning-Words-Generator
This is a Recurrent Neural Network (without LSTM) which is able to read a text file, analyze and train itself to understand the text. Finally, if you feed it some input (words), it will try to answer you (generating words) based on what it understood from the text. No deep learning framework used. Everything is written using pure math.
